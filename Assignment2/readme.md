## Assignment 2 : Multi-user drawing app with mongodb storing


Version used for deployment on [this website](https://polar-tundra-55621.herokuapp.com/).

I have used Heroku and Docker in order to deploy it

You will have the cont folder which contains all the static files for the html page. You'll also find in this folder a folder named canvas which contains some canvas I already saved.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Runs this command in order to install all the modules required by the app listed in the package.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

For this assignment, I have created a MongoDB Cluster in order to deploy it. you can have access to it through TablePlus for instance with this URI :

mongodb+srv://webappcourse:benjaminbejnbaum007@cluster0.fjrea.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority.

If you want to connect through the shell, you can run:

### `mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0.fjrea.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --username webappcourse`

password : benjaminbejnbaum007
