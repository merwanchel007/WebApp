## Assignment 2 : Multi-user drawing app with mongodb storing


Version used for deployment on [this website](https://polar-tundra-55621.herokuapp.com/).

I have used Heroku and Docker in order to deploy it

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Runs this command in order to install all the modules required by the app listed in the package-lock.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

For this assignment, I have created a MongoDB Cluster in order to deploy it. you can have access to it through TablePlus for instance with this URI :

mongodb+srv://webappcourse:benjaminbejnbaum007@cluster0.fjrea.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority.

If you want to connect through the shell, you can run:

### `mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0.fjrea.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --username webappcourse`

password : benjaminbejnbaum007
