## Assignment 3 : Movie Quizz App


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The public folder is generical and was not designed by my hand.

You can find the deployed app at this link : 

http://axiomatic-cheese.surge.sh/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm install`

Runs this command in order to install all the modules required by the app listed in the package-lock.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\


### `npm run build`

In order to deploy it, I used the production building with this command, I also used Surge instead of Heroku because I saw it is fastest for React basic App/
